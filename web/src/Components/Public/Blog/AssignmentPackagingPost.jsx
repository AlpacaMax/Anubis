            One of the largest systems to get a major overhaul in between
            version 1 and version 2 was the way that assignment tests are
            packaged. In the original version, tests were a bit of a free
            for all.

              <Typography gutterBottom className={classes.typography}>
                Eventually some standard functions were added so that
                we could save and store the autograding results, but the testing
                itself was still inconsistent. We were essentially re-writing all the
                code to run the student&apos;s xv6, then parse the output for each
                assignment. Parsing issues that came up would be fixed incrementally
                from assignment to assignment until we had something semi-stable
                by the last assignment.
              </Typography>

              <Typography gutterBottom className={classes.typography}>
                For version 2 we needed better packaging of the assignment tests.
                There are two main improvements that made this change work.

                that assignment, along with the standard autograding
                API and parsing modules.

                Using the Anubis CLI, you can run one quick command to get

                The meta.yaml file is where you give the assignment a name
                and set its release and due dates. You can also set your assignment to be
                hidden from student or not. If the assignment is not hidden, then it
                will become visible to students after the release date. Something to note
                is that these timestamps are interpreted as <b>America/New_York</b>.
                Anubis was first developed before coronavirus made everything remote,
                so it did not make sense to have timestamps be interpreted as a more
                international friendly format like UTC.

                Writing Tests

              <Typography gutterBottom className={classes.typography}>
                The build and test code is all in assingment.py from the generated
                template. There is not actually much code that needs to change from
                assignment to assignment. The only thing that changes is how the
                output is interpreted. For the most part it falls into having some
                form of randomized input and comparing the actual output to an
                expected output.
              </Typography>

                Let&apos;s work on an example from the midterm this semester.
                Students were required to implement a sed program. The sed program
                that they implemented was significantly more simple than the actual
                gnu sed program from coreutils. Their sed program just needed to find
                and replace 3 characters from a file and print it to screen. This
                format is perfect for setting up randomized input, and expected output.
                All we need to do is generate a file and compile it into xv6, then
                run the student&apos;s xv6 and the sed included in coreutils and
                compare the two outputs.

                To let anubis know that this is the build function, we simply
                decorate it with <i>@register_build</i>.
              </Typography>
              <Typography gutterBottom className={classes.typography}>
                The build is pretty simple for this assignment. We use a
                lorem ipsum generator library to fill in a file text.txt with
                a few sentences separated by newlines. This will make it so that
                each time this is run, we should get a relatively random text.txt.
                This fulfills our randomized input requirement.
              </Typography>
              <Typography gutterBottom className={classes.typography}>
                Once our input file is generated, we can build the student xv6
                and report the stdout and build status. We communicate back to
                Anubis by setting the values of the stdout and passed fields in
                a build_result object passed to the build function.

              <Typography gutterBottom className={classes.typography}>
                Using some tricks from the random module of python, we can select
                a random sequence of three characters from the text.txt that was generated
                in the build step. To keep things simple, we&apos;ll always replace the
                chosen string with <i>RPL</i>.
              </Typography>
              <Typography gutterBottom className={classes.typography}>
                We then run both the student sed, and coretuils sed and compare the results.
                The functions xv6_run, exec_as_student, did_xv6_crash and verify_expected
                are all standard Anubis autograding library functions. Formalizing these
                functions is what makes writing these tests so easy. We&apos;re simply
                getting the student output, and the expected output and letting the anubis
                standard functions handle the rest. As long as we handle these steps
                autograding is easy!

                Sending the assignment off to Anubis is very simple. All we need to

                push the autograding image.
