    This route is used to restart / re-enqueue jobs.

    The work required for this is potentially very IO entinsive
    on the database. We basically need to load the entire submission
    history out of the database, reset each, then re-enqueue them
    for processing. This makes resetting a single assignment actually
    very time consuming. For this we need to be a bit smart about how to
    handle this.

    We will split all submissions for the given assignment into
    chunks of 100. We can then push each of those chunks as a
    bulk_regrade job to the rpc workers.
